              To imagine Sisyphus happy is a transcendental step, bringing a tremendous change in the way we live. 
              Adapting the absurdist reality and battling existential crises, the perils of academia still strike like a rolling boulder.
              For ages, generations of authors have written about the myth revolving around Sisyphus, binding his existence with the 
              prison of eternal suffering. Destined to play a game he shall ultimately lose, the existentialist notions of Camus shed 
              light on the brilliance with which he conquers the terrain, only to fall.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              The absurd existentialists think of life as meaningless, having no bigger picture to reveal; it claims that all one has 
              to himself is right now. Camus believes we must imagine Sisyphus happy, as he defies the gods by giving his own life 
              meaning, making each step to the journey important. He says the moment you take control over the rock is the moment you 
              become the hero of the story. Doing this, Sisyphus gives his own life purpose.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              “When the images of earth cling too tightly to memory, when the call of happiness becomes too insistent, it happens that 
              melancholy arises in man’s heart: this is the rock’s victory, this is the rock itself. The boundless grief is too heavy 
              bear…But crushing truths perish from being acknowledged.”
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              When I think of Sisyphus, I can’t help but wonder, “uh, isn’t that me?” In it’s own, twisted, cruel manner, I feel a pinch 
              of correlation between him and my saga with academics. Academia seems to be of Sisyphean nature to me, pushing me off to 
              the bottom. The tension between the use of reason and the unreasonable system creates a paradigm shift, force-feeding 
              unnecessary fatigue. The effort in handing out assignments that deviate far from logic or practicality becomes a thing of 
              the past, in vain. The crippling feeling of alienation as one struggles by themselves, their pleas unheard, their cries 
              for help not seeing the light of day, buried inside.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              The hunger for knowledge eventually ceases when the threshold breaks and all progress is shoved under the carpet. The worst 
              part is, there’s no avoiding it, after all this, the due date awaits your response, whether you like it or not. Days turn 
              to weeks, and the loop remains consistent. It’s the adapting to the‘ let’s just get it over with’ thought process that 
              delivers the final blow and shatters the windows of hope to the shards of hurt.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              This futile search for meaning has reached a dead end. The world provides no more meaning than what one can provide. 
              The hidden virtue of meaninglessness in life: is it enough for us to declare life absurd? If man is the only creature 
              persistently craving meaning, is it not he himself who gives meaning to life? Confronting the irrationality of life makes 
              us a step closer to finding our own meaning.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              For an existentialist like Camus, the awareness that life is absurd is a move towards conquering the meaninglessness of life. 
              He introduces the idea of “acceptance without resignation.” According to him, the most fundamental human act is to choose life. 
              It’s the defiance of meaninglessness that gives life its own meaning.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              In the case of Sisyphus, he should feel pride and joy in every step towards the top. With every step he takes, he defies the gods’ will by 
              simply existing and giving his own life purpose. A leap of faith every day is all it takes to tackle the absurd and give it meaning. 
              A brilliant contradiction.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              With every “so what” added to misfortune, life makes sense again. “If not now, then later.” If the meaning of life is to 
              give it meaning, then I’ll do so on my own accord. If the end of the day calls you unproductive, remind yourself of what 
              progress means to you, because in the end, that is all that matters. Finding what works for you, is what many say is the true 
              journey of life..
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              In the end, I’ve learned to embrace freedom — no chains, no bounds. Taking responsibility for shaping my life, with the 
              decisions I make, the choices I make, and shaping my own destiny. While this may seem crude to many, I too indulge in the 
              occasional “So what.” Rather than depending on external validation, I find fulfilment in my appreciation of life and its 
              moments.
            </p>
