                <strong><em>Ever since we took notice of our surroundings, we have formed opinions about them, yet rarely found 
                the opportunity to voice them.</em></strong> In our society, it’s uncommon for people to openly consider the opinions 
                of their subordinates. Throughout school years, it became evident that gaining recognition or even 
                catching the attention of our teachers required a specific skill set, namely being good in academics or extracurriculars.

                My Idol: Mother
            </strong>
                
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                My idol is my mother. Motherhood, to me, stands as one of the most profound examples of leadership. 
                The journey of motherhood and leadership intertwine in powerful ways, offering significant opportunities 
                for personal and professional growth..
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4"><strong>
                The Power of Empathy
            </strong></p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                I deeply value the power of empathy, and motherhood exemplifies its depth. Through raising children, 
                mothers develop compassion, patience, and a capacity to listen — qualities I believe are essential in leadership. 
                These attributes create a supportive work environment for team members.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                This doesn’t advocate for turning managers into “moms,” but rather, highlights the valuable leadership qualities 
                that can be learned from a mother’s empathetic approach.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                <strong>Resilience amid Challenges:</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Mothers, like anyone else, face challenges, learn from mistakes, and persevere — from sleepless nights 
                to celebrating their children’s achievements. This resilience seamlessly translates into leadership qualities.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                <strong>Time Management</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Observe your mom closely, You will see the amount of work she manages daily. It requires planning, prioritization, 
                and multitasking, skills that enhance productivity.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              <strong>Nurturing Potential and Growth</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Through my years of leadership experience, one key aspect distinguishing a good leader from a great one 
                lies in how they perceive their team. Mothers inherently possess the ability to nurture, creating an environment 
                for their children’s growth, education, and thriving. Similarly, in leadership roles, adopting this nurturing 
                approach becomes crucial in empowering teams, fostering their progress, and unleashing their full capabilities. 
                By acknowledging and allocating resources to advanced team members, we foster an environment of continuous learning 
                and creativity.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                We can’t control others
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Mothers gave birth to us, but they didn’t shape who we are. They have their own lives to navigate
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Their role is to assist us in becoming ourselves, even if that diverges from their expectations!
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                As leaders, everyone in our team possesses unique skills and talents. Our responsibility is to identify 
                and utilize these abilities to assist them in achieving their personal goals. If we exert excessive control, 
                their personal growth might be hindered.”
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              <b><i>Just like a mother tending to her children, a fundamental element in nurturing potential and development in 
                leadership involves recognizing the distinct strengths and talents of each team member. Leaders must honor and respect 
                the diverse range of skills and perspectives that individuals contribute, fostering inclusivity and instilling confidence 
                for team members to perform at their best.</i></b>

            <p class="mb-4">
              <strong>Harsh Realities of Leadership:</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                <b><i>1) Accountability Amplified:</i></b> The final call rests on your shoulders for all that unfolds under our watch; leadership 
                demands accountability, no exceptions.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                <b><i>2) Balancing Fondness and Firmness:</i></b> Embracing the necessity of tough decisions, even when you are fond of them. True leadership 
                entails knowing the silver lining between being lenient and setting boundaries.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                <b><i>3) Vision Beyond the Present:</i></b> Leadership requires a forward gaze. If tomorrow’s horizon remains a blur, 
                perhaps leadership isn’t your forte. Leaders can’t be stuck today.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                <b><i>4) Excuses Fade, Humility Prevails:</i></b> You’ll make mistakes, but you’ll be more likely to 
                attract followers through your acceptance of them. Humility is an admired leadership trait.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                <b><i>5) Motivation Over Mandates:</i></b> Attempting to control to produce more won’t 
                work long-term. People will either rebel, fail to live up to their potential or leave.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                <b><i>6) Team Fortifies Leadership:</i></b> No matter how skilled one is as a leader, 
                it ultimately reflects on the working of the team as well.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                <b><i>7) You can’t avoid conflicts completely:</i></b> You can run but can’t hide from conflicts. Eventually, little things 
                can become big things. The sooner you resolve it the less damage you’ll allow.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                <b><i>8) Misunderstandings are the Norm</i></b> You can have the best intentions, but you’ll still be misunderstood. 
                People will cling to one word you say when you give an hour-long talk. You’ll have to continually get better at communicating. 
                It’s a part of leading people who are different from you.
